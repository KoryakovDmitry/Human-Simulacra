## Overview
Large language models (LLMs) are recognized as systems that closely mimic aspects of human intelligence. This capability has attracted attention from the social science community, who see the potential in leveraging LLMs to replace human participants in experiments, thereby reducing research costs and complexity. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for large language models personification, including a strategy for constructing virtual characters' life stories from the ground up, a Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism capable of simulating human cognitive processes, and a psychology-guided evaluation method to assess human simulations from both self and observational perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our constructed simulacra can produce personified responses that align with their target characters.

At each step, humans are involved in thoroughly reviewing the generated content, ensuring that it is free from biases and harmful information.</a>

<a>Figure 2: **Multi-Agent Cognitive Mechanism.** This mechanism involves four LLM-driven agents. The **Thinking Agent** / **Emotion Agent** handles logical/emotional analysis and logical/emotional memory construction. The **Memory Agent** manages retrieval of memories, while the **Top Agent** coordinates all activities. Upon receiving a stimulus, these agents collaborate to generate appropriate responses, simulating complex human cognitive processes.</a>
